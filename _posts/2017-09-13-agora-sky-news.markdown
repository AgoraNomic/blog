### Crisis Strikes Agora

It has recently come to light that the modern Agoran economy is built on a
foundation of tissue paper and lies, as it turns out that the rules only
give people permission to partake in the economy without giving them the ability
to do so. An emergency fix to this problem is currently being considered; if
one wishes to partake in banishing the state of emergency caused by the lack of
oversight in the implementation of the economy, now is the time to act. This
instability (along with some issues external to Agora), has led long-time
player ais523, to take a hiatus from Agora. This paper wishes them well on
their break.

### Borduria Leadership Vacant; Region in Turmoil

After the unexpected vacancy of the region's governer, citizens of Borduria
are faced with an even larger uncertainty. Dry drought conditions over the
summer has led to a poor wheat harvest in the region, affecting many local
industries, most of which are agrian in nature. Without a clear leader, the
future of the region is unclear, although many citizens questioned appear to be
stoic about the situation; no doubt that many remember the wars between Agora
and other nomics of days gone past. As of printing it is currently unknown when
the good citizens of Borduria is expected to have a governer again.
