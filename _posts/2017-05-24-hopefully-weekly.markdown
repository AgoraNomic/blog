### The Short and Sweet

A successful scam, several new players, and more activity than Agora has
seen in a long time! Current discussion and actions focus on improving
and filling offices, economics, and agencies.


### Economics

Estates have been instated. A discussion about the future of the
economy rages on.

NB: The shiny pending system has been temporarily suspended by the
Junta. Ais523 is the only person that can pend a proposal. E has offered
to do so for anyone that pays Agora a small donation of 5 shinies. *Editor's
note: actually 4 shinies.*

### Winning

Ais523 and nichdel received wins via Junta.

Many ribbons have recently been claimed.

A couple agencies related to Trust Tokens have been created, hopefully
bringing more action to that win condition.

### Law and Order

Quite a few CFJs have been issued and judged in recent times. See G.'s
site for more info [1].


### Power Shifts

After a successful scam, nichdel and ais523 received wins and ais523
now leads a Junta [2]. The mechanism for the scam currently remains
open at the time of writing.

Currently four elections are underway [3]. This is part of a larger
initiative to fill every office [4]


### Offshore Organization

Several players are currently working together to improve the way we
record and display reports outside the mailing list. Much work is
remains and many things are subject to change, but a provisional front
page already exists [5].
