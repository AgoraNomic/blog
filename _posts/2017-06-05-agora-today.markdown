### The Major events

A surge of philosophical discussion took hold of Agora. This resulted in
a lot of CFJs and the deregristration of some players. After that,
activity cooled down somewhat and the dust seems to have settled now.


### Politics

The Junta of ais523 is still in effect. The loophole that enabled the
scam has been closed however. The deregristration of nichdel left the
offices of Assessor and ADoP vacant, which have since been picked up by
Quazie.

### Legislation

Several legislation projects are under discussion: The development of
the economy, a reform of the judicial system, and ways to introduce more
gameplay. There is also a proposal competition revolving around fixing
existing problems with the ruleset.

### Science

Several experimental Agencies have been established that attempt to
produce subNomics or other games.


### Academia

Votes for the Silver Quill of 2016 can be submitted currently.
G. was awarded the degree Associate of Nomic (A.N.) for his thesis "A
Multi-Tiered, Multi-Controlled Currency System".


*Editor's Notes:
As the new editor of the Agoran newspaper I thank my predecessor nichdel
for his work on the newspaper and express my hope that e will come back
to Agora.*
